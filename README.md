# ü§î Description

**Philosophers** (represented by parts of a program) sit around a table, with a big plate of spaghetti at its center. They each have a fork, but they need two forks to eat ; so they need to borrow their neighbor's fork to eat.

Of course, if they borrow a neighbor's fork, the neighbor can't use the fork. The processes / threads must communicate, to know the state of the forks (and of the other philosophers) at all times. There must also be a parent process that monitors everything.

# üìô Philosophers
This project I have to write two programes:
- The First Program (**Mandatory Part**):
  - Each philosopher should be a thread.
  - One fork between each philosopher, therefore if they are multiple philosophers, there will be a fork at the right and the left of each philosopher.
  - To avoid philosophers duplicating forks, I should protect the forks state with a mutex for each of them.
- The Second Program (**Bonus Part**):
  - All the forks are in the Middle of the table.
  - They have no states in memory but the number of available forks is represented by a semaphore.
  - Each philosopher should be a process and the main process should not be a philosopher.

# ‚öôÔ∏è Compilation
- Compiling The First Program (**Mandatory Part**): `make -C philo/` 
- Compiling The Second Program (**Bonus Part**) : `make -C philo_bonus/`
# üîë Execute

- The Two Programs Take The Following Arguments:
  - **number_of_philosophers**: is the number of philosophers and also the number of forks.
  - **time_to_die**: is in milliseconds, if a philosopher doesn‚Äôt start eating **‚Äôtime_to_die‚Äô** milliseconds after starting their last meal or the beginning of the simulation, it dies.
  - **time_to_eat**: is in milliseconds and is the time it takes for a philosopher to eat. During that time they will need to keep the two forks.
  - **time_to_sleep**: is in milliseconds and is the time the philosopher will spend sleeping.
  - **number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat**: argument is optional, if all philosophers eat at least ‚Äônumber_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat‚Äô the
simulation will stop. If not specified, the simulation will stop only at the death of a philosopher.

**Example**: Without **number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat** Argument `./philo 4 500 200 200`</br>
**Example**: With **number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat** Argument `./philo 7 310 100 100 7`
